              <p>
              Everything EB1 Filling Experts shares is meant to educate and inform. However, we want to be clear: we're not lawyers and don't provide legal representation or guidance before U.S. immigration authorities.
              </p>
              <p>
              Since every person's immigration circumstances are different, we encourage you to seek professional legal advice from an immigration attorney who understands your particular needs and goals.
