            We prioritize data privacy and security. By using the Services, you agree to our privacy policy, which is
            integrated into these legal terms. Please note that our Services operate from servers located in the United States.
            If you access our Services from a country with different data protection laws or regulations, your data will be
            transferred to and processed in the United States. Your continued use of the Services constitutes your consent to
            this data transfer and processing.
          </p>

          <h4>Term and Termination</h4>
          <p>
            These terms remain in effect while you use the Services. We may refuse access to the Services (including blocking
            specific IP addresses) at our sole discretion for any reason or no reason at all, including breach of these terms
            or applicable law, without notice or liability. We reserve the right to terminate your account and remove your content
            at any time without notice. If your account is suspended or terminated for any reason, you may not create a new account
            under your own name, an assumed identity, or any third party's name. We may pursue legal action, including civil,
            criminal, and injunctive remedies, in addition to account suspension or termination.
          </p>

          <h2>Changes and Service Interruptions</h2>
          <p>
            We reserve the right to modify, remove, or change the Services' content at any time without prior notice. We are
            not obligated to update any information regarding our Services. Changes to pricing, service availability, or features
            will not create liability for us or any third party.
          </p>
          <p>
            We cannot guarantee uninterrupted access to the Services. Technical issues, maintenance requirements, or system
            failures may cause errors, delays, or temporary unavailability. We may alter, update, suspend, or discontinue any
            portion of the Services without prior notification. You acknowledge that we are not responsible for any losses,
            damages, or inconvenience resulting from service unavailability or discontinuation. These terms do not obligate us
            to provide updates, maintenance, or ongoing support for the Services.
          </p>

          <h3>Governing Law</h3>
          <p>
            These terms and your use of the Services are governed by and interpreted under the laws of the State of California,
            without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
          </p>

          <h3>Dispute Resolution</h3>
          <p>
            Both parties agree that any legal action arising from these terms or the Services will be brought in the state and
            federal courts located in Alameda County, California. You and we both waive any objections to jurisdiction or venue
            in these courts. This provision does not apply to the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) or the
            United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. Any claim or legal action must be
            initiated within one year of when the cause of action occurred.
          </p>

          <h3>Corrections and Corrections</h3>
          <p>
            Service descriptions, pricing, availability, and other information may contain typographical errors, inaccuracies,
            or incomplete details. We reserve the right to correct any mistakes or omissions and update information on the
            Services at any time without prior notice.
          </p>

          <h3>Disclaimers</h3>

            interpreted against us and that you waive any arguments based on electronic form or lack of signature.
