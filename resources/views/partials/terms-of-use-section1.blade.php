          <p>
            Information you provide through the Services is not intended for distribution in any jurisdiction where doing

            the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
            Act (HIPAA), as our Services are not designed to meet these compliance standards. Additionally, you may not use
            the Services in any manner that would violate the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).
